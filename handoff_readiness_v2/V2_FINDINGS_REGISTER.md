# GlobalStrat+ competition readiness v2 — findings register

Prepared 2026-08-28 against `competition-rc-2026.08.27.3` / `7452ee7`.
Findings were recorded before repair. P0 blocks; P1 degrades; P2 cosmetic.

| ID | Area | Sev | Description | Reproduction / evidence | Initial status |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| V2-001 | Determinism boundary | P0 | `output_sha256` covered only financials, performance-index rows, and leaderboard rows. It omitted coherence, product/market outcomes, adoption, resilience, share price history, and mutable `Team` state carried into the next round. | Compare original `complete_manifest()` at `7452ee7` with `_run_phase_1()`. | **Closed** — see closure entry below |
| V2-002 | Reconstruction / disputes | P1 | The input manifest stores decision-event IDs and payload hashes, but not the decision payload, scenario parameters, market state, starting team state, or engine configuration. The backup can reconstruct these, but the manifest alone cannot prove the calculation or explain an input. | Inspect `prepare_manifest()`: its fields are game/round IDs, six audit metadata fields, active team IDs, and scenario ID. | **Closed** — see closure entry below |
| V2-003 | Dispute tooling | P1 | Instructor decision drill-down showed the stored snapshot and lock actor/time, but not each accepted save's actor, server timestamp, request ID, endpoint, payload, and hash. | V2 API/UI now exposes ordered audit evidence in the historical decisions modal. | Repaired |
| V2-004 | Concurrent operator actions | P0 | Reopen, deadline change, and advance did not share the row-lock transaction used by close/process. | V2 adds atomic game/round locks and returns 409 for deadline mutation after close. Correction concurrency and an integration race remain pending. | Partially repaired |
| V2-005 | Failure visibility | P1 | A Phase-1 exception rolled back `PROCESSING`; `_mark_failed()` then required the rolled-back value, leaving no FAILED indicator. | Injected disk-full exception now leaves `Round.processing_status=FAILED`; focused and full suites pass. | Repaired |
| V2-006 | Backend restart / narrative | P1 | Phase 2 runs only in a daemon thread. A worker restart can silently abandon it; no durable queued job or startup retry exists, and an abrupt process death cannot populate `narrative_error`. Numeric results remain valid, but operator visibility/recovery is incomplete. | Process a round, terminate the worker after Phase 2 dispatch and before completion, restart, then inspect `narrative_generated`, `narrative_error`, and logs. | Open |
| V2-007 | Audit integrity | P1 | Audit models reject a second `.save()`, but queryset `.update()`/`.delete()` and direct SQL can alter them. The database does not enforce append-only history, so stored data alone cannot prove absence of operator/database tampering. | In an isolated database, call `DecisionAuditEvent.objects.filter(pk=...).update(action='tampered')`; it bypasses model `save()`. | Open |
| V2-008 | Dry-run failure path | P2 | The `process_round(dry_run=True)` exception handler referenced undefined `sid`, masking the original failure. | Removed invalid rollback; outer atomic block owns rollback. | Repaired |
| V2-009 | Frontend verification environment | P1 | Lockfile selects `react-router-dom` 7.1.1 (Node >=20), but the VM runs Node 18.20.8. Production build completes, while Jest cannot resolve the router and one suite cannot start. | `npm install` reports EBADENGINE; `CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false` has 1 pass / 1 load failure. | Open |

## New findings raised by the GSP-CRV2-01 ordering audit

| ID | Area | Sev | Description | Reproduction / evidence | Status |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| V2-010 | RNG cohort key | P2 | Two different cohort keys are in use. `core/engine/rng.py` seeds on `game.section_id or game.id`; `sc_engine._seed()` and `compliance_engine` seed on `game.id`. Two sections of one class running the same scenario therefore share an event stream but not a supply-chain or compliance stream. | Compare `core/engine/rng.py` with `core/engine/sc_engine.py:_seed` and `core/engine/compliance_engine.py`. | Open — not changed here; altering a seed changes published results, so it is a competition-rules decision. |
| V2-011 | Shared RNG stream | P2 | The supply-chain and compliance passes consume a single `random.Random` across all teams, so draw *n* belongs to whichever (team, regime, market) triple reaches the roll *n*-th. Iteration order is now explicit and replay is exact, but adding or withdrawing a team shifts every later team's draw. | `core/engine/compliance_engine.py:enforce_compliance`; `core/engine/sc_engine.py:run_sc_state`. | Open — same reason as V2-010. |

## Closure entries

### V2-001 — expanded output envelope (P0) — closed

`output_sha256` now covers **72 enumerated sections**: game/round lifecycle,
roster, every accepted decision table (including all ten supply-chain decision
tables), live market/event/modifier state, all eighteen carried per-team state
tables, and all published result tables. The section list, each section's
natural key, and the classification of every model field are recorded in
`backend/core/services/manifest_schema_v2.json`; every excluded field carries a
written justification, and `test_manifest_determinism` fails if a model gains a
field that no rule and no justification covers.

Phase-2 prose is hashed separately as `narrative_sha256` and reported
separately. Measured wall clock is excluded from the competitive hash and kept
in the input envelope, where it is a frozen fact about the starting state.

- Code: `core/services/manifest_sections.py`, `manifest_snapshot.py`,
  `manifest_schema.py`, `canonical_json.py`, `resolution_manifest.py`;
  migration `0061`.
- Tests: `core/tests/test_manifest_determinism.py` (34), plus the updated
  envelope assertion in `core/tests/test_competition_hardening.py`.
- Evidence: `evidence/determinism/` — four replays of game 32 round 1 all
  produce `ba9f711194866fe36226def40e3dee636dfc2864301e98e57abc212e96dd3393`,
  including a second container on Debian 12 / Python 3.11 / `Asia/Kolkata` /
  `de_DE.UTF-8`. Narrative hashes differ in all four.
- Docs: `DETERMINISM_BOUNDARY.md`, `evidence/determinism/README.md`.

### V2-002 — manifest sufficient to explain an input (P1) — closed

`input_sha256` covers canonical snapshots of the accepted decision payloads
themselves (not hashes of them), the full scenario and engine configuration,
per-class configuration overrides, live market/event/modifier state, starting
team and per-team state, the roster, the ordered decision audit trail, the RNG
seed derivation inputs, and the applied migration list. The code revision and a
host fingerprint are recorded alongside — outside the hash, deliberately, so a
cross-environment replay can match.

Surrogate primary keys appear nowhere: every row is identified by a natural-key
token with foreign keys resolved recursively, so a diff names the row a person
can recognise (`team(game("…")|"Nova Circuit")`) rather than an integer.

The envelope is versioned. Version-1 manifests stay readable exactly as stored
and are never reinterpreted as version 2 — `require_schema_version` refuses, so
a v1 hash cannot be compared against a v2 hash and called a match.

- Command: `manage.py replay_round` verifies input integrity **before** any
  mutation (exit 2, engine not run) and prints per-section diffs on mismatch
  (exit 3). `manage.py dump_manifest_schema --check` guards the inventory.
- Negative tests: a corrupted decision payload, a corrupted scenario value and
  a corrupted carried-state value each fail verification before processing,
  each naming the exact row and field — `evidence/determinism/negative/`.
- Durability: each envelope is also written to a content-addressed file under
  `<COMPETITION_BACKUP_DIR>/manifests/`, so it survives losing the database.

## Scope notes

- The Phase-2 LLM path is outside the existing output hash and is dispatched only after the deterministic transaction commits. No LLM value is read by the Phase-1 scoring call graph. This part of the v1 claim is structurally sound, subject to outage/restart verification.
- Wall-clock values are lifecycle/audit metadata or duration fields. They are excluded from the competitive hash by rule (`manifest_sections.MEASURED_TIME_FIELDS`) and kept in the input envelope as frozen facts about the starting state.
- The unordered-query sweep is complete: 93 iterated querysets in `core/engine/` had no explicit ordering; all now declare one except six documented exemptions whose result cannot depend on order. See `ORDERING_AUDIT.md`. An AST test fails the suite on any new unordered loop, and a forward/reverse insertion test re-runs the whole Phase-1 pipeline over reordered rows.
